# WMUHAPP
Radio app for Muhlenberg

Abstract:
The goal of this project is to create a mobile application for the WMUH radio station at Muhlenberg College. This application will be designated for use by the patrons of the radio station in order to help its users engage with the community around them more freely and in more immersive ways. The application will enable users to stream the station music, view playing schedules, submit their requests to the station, and interact with the station on social media more conveniently on their smartphones. 

This application was programmed with the Flutter SDK and the Dart Programming Language. Android Studio and XCode were used as the primary IDEs.
